# side-projects
Small side projects, largely to practice coding.

It must be noted that most of these programs were written as I was learning how to code, and do not reflect my current ability.

Here follows a brief description of each of the programs:

1-d Heat:
Simulates the 1-d heat equation across a line. First generates a heat distribution along a line, and then evolves it.

3-body system:
Simulates a 3-body system in 2 dimensions subject to Newtonian gravity and bouncing at the borders.

Borders:
Encodes the borders needed in the program 3-body system

Caesar:
 Holds some of the functions used in cipher.

Lebesque norm:
 Shows Circles in different Lebesque norms.

Nuclear Decay:
 Simulates the decay of an isotropic grid of material using monte-carlo methods.

Prime Checker:
 Generates the primes between 0 and a value n. Then creates a grid showing these primes.

Weierstrass:
 Shows a Weierstrass function


Cipher:
  Creates a bit shift cipher which shifts each bit depending on how much the previous bit was shifted.

Elliptic curve:
 A fun little animation I created to try to understand elliptic curves a little better.

Fourier Decomposition:
 Finds the first “ext” values in the Fourier series of a given function, the default function is a polynomial.

Golden ratio:
 Shows the attractional behaviour of the two values for the golden ratio.

pi_self_finding_digits:
 This program finds the self-finding digits of pi up to 10^6 digits long.
 The self-finding digits are digits which encode their own position.
 This program iterates through different values defining the first index in the decimal expansion of pi.
